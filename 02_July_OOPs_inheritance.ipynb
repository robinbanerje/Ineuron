Inheritance creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.\n",

        "- Code organization: Inheritance can help to organize code by grouping related classes together. This can make code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
        "- Flexibility: Inheritance makes code more flexible by allowing programmers to create new classes that are based on existing classes. This allows programmers to customize existing classes to meet the needs of their specific application."
